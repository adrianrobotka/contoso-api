                <h1>Contoso festival 2018 - EULA</h1>

                <p>Az EULA jelentése End User License Agreement, azaz végfelhasználói licencszerződés, vagy másképp
                    végfelhasználói engedély.</p>

                <p>Ezek elolvasására rendszerint egy-egy alkalmazás telepítésekor nyílik lehetősége a felhasználónak, és
                    a telepítés folytatása az elfogadását jelenti. </p>

                <p>Software companies often make special agreements with large businesses and government entities that
                    include support contracts and specially drafted warranties.
                </p>

                <p>Many EULAs assert extensive liability limitations. Most commonly, an EULA will attempt to hold
                    harmless
                    the software licensor in the event that the software causes damage to the user's computer or data,
                    but
                    some software also proposes limitations on whether the licensor can be held liable for damage that
                    arises through improper use of the software (for example, incorrectly using tax preparation software
                    and
                    incurring penalties as a result). One case upholding such limitations on consequential damages is
                    M.A.
                    Mortenson Co. v. Timberline Software Corp., et al. Some EULAs also claim restrictions on venue and
                    applicable law in the event that a legal dispute arises.</p>

                <p>Some copyright owners use EULAs in an effort to circumvent limitations the applicable copyright law
                    places on their copyrights (such as the limitations in sections 107–122 of the United States
                    Copyright
                    Act), or to expand the scope of control over the work into areas for which copyright protection is
                    denied by law (such as attempting to charge for, regulate or prevent private performances of a work
                    beyond a certain number of performances or beyond a certain period of time). Such EULAs are, in
                    essence,
                    efforts to gain control, by contract, over matters upon which copyright law precludes control. [1]
                    This
                    kind of EULAs concurs in aim with DRM and both may be used as alternate methods for widening control
                    over software.</p>
